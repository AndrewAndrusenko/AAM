AAM REFACTORING BULLET POINTS
1 Multiple subscribes => to RxJS pipes with switch map and so on
2 Async Validators => Create by Example: set unique errors manually through setError method and avoid any request to the db unless value has 
  been changed => check dirty and touched status before sending a request. Noted.. when user changes values by selecting whole old value and pasting instead new value, field is still in untouched state...
3 Access control model => change request to db with retrieving data form app variable containing all restrictions
  Retrieve static tables from indexDB storage and don't request DB
4 Check error blocks in template field?.errors?[''requiered]
5 Unsubscibe via onDestroy pattern and takeUntil.. (Not relised yet)
