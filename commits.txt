For examlple if for any given pair portfolio - secid of potential buy order there is a sell not-accounted order then DB function f_i_o_create_orders_by_mp will generate an error message. The main issue with implementing is to generate exception in postgres function and then use the same dataset one more time to insert new orders. Using SELECT INTO in WITH clause is forbidden and to avoid duplicate query the decesion is to create temp table to store portential new orders
2|| Orders Table UI = > added status filter for retrived dataset and status filter for complex search

16/12/23 - 18/12/23
1|| DB&Model PL detail analysis => Created DB function f_i_get_pl_dynamic_with_npv.sql to provide data for detailed factor analysis of clients revenue. Function calculates realized profit and loss based on fifo data and unrealized profit/loss comparing current position evaluated by market price and costs of creating position retrieved from fifo data. An idea is to provide an UI to create chart showing the dynamic of portfolio revenue splitting it by separate instruments and graphicly demonstrating its contribution in final financial result of managment

19-20/12/23
1|| UI Performance Chart => 
  Implemented stack area chart for revenue structure analysis in dynamic.

2|| Accounting related interfaces have been transferred to the separate file. All dependant components and services have been updated accordingly
3|| Any type refactoring => Started getting rid of any type and replace it with correct types
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/02/2024 - 17/02/2024
1|| Accounting schemes  UI & DB =>
  Created DB table bcSchemesParameters to store all parameters which could be used to create new accounting schemes. List of parameters is determined by function responsible for handling given buisness process. A parameter is similar to an api variable which is replaced by real value from business object when function is executed by the user
  Introduced  new object - "Process" and created respective DB table bcSchemesProcesses. Process object is used to make a link between given buisness process (function/module responsible for it) and list of parameters availble for the process
  Create new table component AppAccSchemesParamsTable to show all availble parameters for the given process. The component is availble in the form of modify acccounting scheme. User can copy parameter to the clipboard by making a double click on it.
  Table component AppAccSchemesAL_Table has been introduced to retrieve/modify accounting account schemes data (entries stored bAccountTransaction and affect clients accounts)
  Form component AppAccSchemesAL_FormComponent has been created to modify accounting account schemes. 
  Table component AppAccSchemesLL_Table has been introduced to retrieve/modify accounting ledger schemes data (entries stored bLedgerTransactions and don't affect clients accounts)
  Form component AppAccSchemesLL_FormComponent has been created to modify accounting ledger schemes.
  Parameters are added to the scheme in the format of ${parameter_name:raw}. Parameters could be used to customize entries attributes such as entry's  details, entry amount, date and accounts corresponding.
  There are two options to set the accounts corresponding in the accounting scheme. User can choose/set static account number from the existed accounts or insert a parameter linked to transaction's accounting objects. For example, client cash account is available through  ${pAccontId} parameter while clients trades are being processed
  Every process id is linked to the scheme id. All transactions have to be generated during the function exuction of the given process must have the same scheme id inside accounts related schemes and inside ledger schemes as well. The function retrieves all accounting schemes with the process's scheme id from bLedgerTransactions and bAccountTransaction
  Implemented UI to retrive account number by id inputed by a user. If account hasn't been found then text input stored since text pattern could be used as parameter in accounting scheme and be populated by respective module while entries are created 
  New parameter counterparty code has been added to the api of SellTrade/BuyTrade acconting process 
2|| Accounting schemes interfaces have been transferred to the separate file. All dependant components and services have been updated accordingly

2|| Refactored function creating new depo accounts if they are required to generate trading accounting. Refactored to RxJS pipes  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/03/24 - 13/03/24
1|| Bugs fixings related to local settings of a user computer. Testing has been started using different client computers and different browsers. Local dates format, numbers and etc
2|| Created pipe and functions to store Moex Boards list. All requests go to the local storage or to the exhaustMap pipe if there is no data in storage yet. When exhaustMap pipe receives data to save it to the storage and send it to the subscribers. The same pipe has been created for market segments
3|| Optimized loading big components by removing duplicates queries to DB
4|| Local Tunnel has been added to the node servers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14/03/2024 - 17/03/2024
1|| Portfolio form => Changing portfolio type in edit mode has been disabled
2|| Selection service => Changed logic of selection all. Now only filtered data is selected. It is useful when a user selects a list of accounts based on the text filter and wants to use it for the next search. Example is to get accounts balance for the specific group
3|| Account Selection Table Fix => All accounts are available for selection. Table initiation is moved to ngInit to get actual value of action variable
4|| Balance Sheet Table refactored =>
  All search parameters have been transferred into DB procedures in order to limit the resulting dataset. Used pattern allows to pass null value of parameter if it has to be ignored
  Implemented new search parameter - account type
  All DB  procedures have been updated accordingly
  Used data range as a search parameter and and new pattern for arrays parameters
5|| Balance Sheet check and deep check updated according to new DB functions
Fix: Balance sheet: dates with entries are updated after execution of closing and opening balance functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18/03/2024 -20/03/2024
|| entries table => complex search by account type
|| npv_dynamic db function refactored due to the change in balance db functions. all related db functions such as fees, performance, revenue factor have been updated accordingly
|| Positions table => Added filter select list which is updated on dataset refreshing  
|| Trade Form => Fixed NG100 => Form is being patched with data in ngOnInit hook and only then all necessary validators are added
|| Market Service (Marketstack) => Added step to copy data received from Marketstack server to the main table of market quotes
|| Trade Form - Create on Example => Fixed creating new trade on existing one. Trade date and value date set to today and allocated qty to zero to prevent disabling the form
|| Positions Table => Added rows with NPV values. User is able to filter dataSet by selecting NPV from secid filter list and get fast snapshot
|| Menu component css
|| Portfolio Positions Fees => Fixed: When portfolios list is empty then DB function f_i_get_deducted_fees_per_portfolios_on_date.sql returns fees for all portfolios
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21/03/2024 - 30/03/2024
1|| Restrictions implementations => 
  Added new table to DB scheme
  Created functions to retrieve data  
  New version of fucntion to crete orders taking into account leverage restrictions => Process has been splitted in two step: 
    fisrt new function f_i_o_prepare_orders_data_by_mp_v2.sql prepares data to be inserted according to leverage handle parameter
    second function f_i_o_create_orders_by_mp_v2.sql is responsible for inserting orders data and canceling process if there are oppositie orders
    created new functions to retrieve data regarding unaccounted orders f_i_o_get_orders_unaccounted_qty.sql (unaacounted orders are the created orders with any status excepet accounted and they haven't been reflected with client balance as executed trades)
    3|| generating orders inv-generate-orders-table.component.ts => notificating about out of date market prices => Addedys when parameter to set quantity of days when quote is deemed as irrelevant. If there are quotes below set limit in order set then dataset filered to show irrelevant orders and alert is raised
2|| Store history of a portfolio changing parameters such as: client, strategy etc. Created UI and DB updated accordingly:( function to retrieve data and trigger to store history)
3|| Manual market quote insert => Created new form and services are updated. Only manually inserted quotes are available for editing or deleting
4|| instrument table=> implemented complex search by instrument type or ISIN; updated UI
5|| generate orders & leverage => UI => new select list to choose strategy how to handle violating of leverage restriction

01/04/2024 - 12/04/2024
1|| Restrictions implementations stage 2 =>
  In addition to a leverage restriction new types of limits have been introduced. Such as:
	restriction setting a max weight of particular instrument in the client portfolio
	restriction setting a max weight of type instruments in the client portfolio. for example option must not exceed 15% of the portfolio
	restriction setting a max weight of instruments with particular listing value in the client portfolio. for example junk shares (listing=3) must not exceed 10%
  Refactored DB function f_i_r_get_restrictions.sql in order to retrieve restrictions according to new restriction model scheme
  Rewritten DB function f_i_o_get_orders_unaccounted.sql to provide unaccounted orders according to the restriction type
2|| Created new function f_i_o_prepare_orders_data_by_mp_v3.sql to calculate order according to new restriction model:
  the function has been fully refactored
  the function calculates the max possible order amount based on instrument, instrument type and listing restriction. then takes min among them and initial order amount. and as a last step leverage restriction is applied to orders calculated in the previous step
3|| Update UI to generate orders. function and several fields have been replaced by new ones

13/04/2024 -15/04/2024
1|| Restrictions UI =>
  Created inv-restriction-schemes-table.component to retrieve list of restrictions by portfolio or whole set.
  Created inv-restriction-main-form to create/modify/delete restrictions. Validators are dynamically changing depending on restriction type. for example: field parameter is required for instrument restriction and its value is verified against securities list
  Created service to handle restriction related tasks restrictions-handling.service.ts Added functions to retrieve, update restrictions data. Middleware layer has been updated accordingly
2|| Added listing parameter to instrument table => new parameter is available in the instrument table and could be updated via instrument form
3|| DB d_i_restrictions unique indexes = > implemented three unique indexes to prevent creating duplicate restrictions per type. new errors descriptions have been added to the dictionary

16/04/2024 - 21/04/2024
1|| Middleware authentication fixing/refactoring =>
  JS passport applied to protect api from unauthorized access.
  Realized sessions access.
  Every session has to be authorized via application login form. Changed route verification policy and cookie data.
  Logout procedure fixed/refactored. Session duly destroyed and local storage cleared in order to ensure ActiveGuard of UI correct behavior.
  UI refactored so when session became unauthorized (due to server relaunch or etc) user is notified and prompted to log in again
2|| DB created a new role for middle officers and provided privileges according to its business functions. Besides access restrictions to UI components realized DB role access segregation as the final layer of data protection
3|| DB RLS (row level security policy). For new role of middle officer implemented RLS for client table (dclient) and accounting entries table (AL and LL)
  RLS on client table allows to show client data only for counterparts and hide sensitive data of investment clients
  RLS on accounting entries table implemented in terms of creating and delete transaction. As a part of allocation process middle officer is responsible of processing trade and creating corresponding accounting. All such accounting created automatically, by functions. RLS allowed to restrict middle officer rights to creating and deleting only autoprocessed entries and the role is forbidden to create any manual entries.
  Changed accounting creating form by excluding autoprocessed type of transaction from UI. Accordingly accounting entries table has been by removing option to copy autoprocessed entry and make it as manual one.
4|| Middleware routing according to DB access role => refactored middleware api call execution by redirecting them to the query pool connected to DB via specific access role
5|| HTTP error handling => Implemented http call interceptor in order to properly notify user about error and particularly regarding lack of permissions or unauthorized api call
7|| Allocation function rollback => Realized correct error handling procedure in order to rollback all created transactions (entries and fifo) if anything went wrong
8|| Fixed: Trade vs market quote deviation notification => Bug before verifying its required to convert prices to one currency
9|| Fixed: Allocation accounting - FIFO/Accounting => Roll back FIFO/Accounting when any of accounting fails
10|| Fixed: Revenue Factor shows graph from the last selected object if new object is reused and there's no need to reload it

22/04/2024-01/05/2024
1|| Investment restrictions verification =>
  Created DB function to calculate violated investment restrictions. All restriction are being verified against current relative position, model portfolio ratio and current position with created orders deemed as executed
  Created UI table to verify investment restrictions. Full UI table is available in portfolios block and the same component with necessary filtering has been added to portfolio, client and Strategy tab
2|| Allocation with restrictions verification => Refactored order execution/allocation process.  
  Each new allocated trade beforehand is verified against all restrictions, and a list of violations is demonstrated to a user with options to accept/reject potential allocation.
  Main allocation function is refactored to RxJS and moved to the allocation service.
  Created new component inv-restriction-verify-alloc-table.component/inv-restriction-verify-alloc-table.component.tsto show violated investment restriction with functions to approve allocation or reject it.
  Added new DB functions f_i_r_verify_allocation_vs_restrictions.sql to calculate violations and update middleware accordingly
3|| New RLS (bAccountTransaction/bLedgerTransactions) =>
  New table bcTransactionType_Ext_Privileges has been introduced to DB.
  Table contains transaction types allowed to be inserted or deleted for the particular access role. User based on its accessRole can to modify only transactions types that exist in the table
  Thus RLS on insert and delete entries has been granted to public and conditions on existing links in bcTransactionType_Ext_Privileges have been added
4|| Introduced new DB roles aam_back_officer, aam_portfolio_manager, aam_trader, aam_accountant.
  Middleware: For each DB access role a separate connection configuration has been  and a separate query pool  is opened based on role configuration. accessRole is an obligatory parameter for a request.  Based on access role server select a right pool
  DB: granted necessary privileges and added several RLS policies to segregate access.
  Implemented RLS policy on accounts tables to separate auto depo account creation as a part of allocation process from manual account modifying (accountant privilege)
5|| Fixed order delete process. Added RLS policy on dorders to prevent deletion of client orders linked to bulk order
6|| Correct error handler for currencies and market quotes external importing

02/05/2024 - 15/05/24
The project is completed according to the planned functionality list on 8th of May. 
The second phase is to prepare technical and presentation documentation, thorough testing, fixing and small refactoring. 
1|| Created UI and backend to grant privileges on transaction type (accounting generating) to a specific access role.Table: acc-access-transaction-types-table.component.ts Form: acc-access-transaction-types-form.component.ts
2|| DB Roles => Introduced a new role - salesRM (responsible for updating dclients => tested, creating and updaing portfolios)
3|| The project is made accessible through Ngrok service https://parrot-organic-overly.ngrok-free.app
4|| Fixing
* Fixed: No action parameter in the portfolio form =>  Pass action parameter to portfolio page when negative by tree. Default set as view when no action parameter has been passed
* Fixed: First opening of portfolio pages requested the whole set of fees schedules - portfolios => Correction onChange lifehook verifies idportfolio is not undefined 
* Fixed: Unable to create fees schedule from portfolio page => Fixed by passing necessary portfolio parameters to the form
* Fixed: Removed all pool queries which don't use common module with pool redirection
* Fixed: Incorrect FIFO position calculation if there are more than one in trade within a day. => DB function f_fifo_get_cost_detailed_data.sql Added rest qty as ordering parameter in order to select last positions trades correctly
* Fixed: FIFO position search with date parameter secid and portfolio => fixed by removing last boolean parameter in middle ware query execution function
+ Checked market quotes and currencies rates import on middleOfficer access role. Everythhig is okay

30/05/2024
|| Access segregation model
|| NgRok to access via web. Local Tunnel has been dropped due to its instability
* Fixed performance fee calculation => Changed function f_i_get_npv_dynamic. Portfolio NPV is built upon balance data and in order to get the whole list of positions balance data have to be calculated from the last closed operational day at least. Thus balance data retrieved from the least between last closed open day and start_date parameter 
* Fixed entries table complex search => refactored common function which transfoms date range objet to postgres range - open range without end date and corrected reset of search form 
- In Progress =>  Global style refactoring

04/06/2024:
|| Global style refactoring:
  - Changed pre-built theme by direct modification of its css file. Primary color has been changed to indigo
  - A set of color parameters have been introduced inside styles.css. These params are used to style non-material elements of UI
  - 95% of local components styles has been replaced by global styling via style.scc
  - Created unified flexible style approach.Easy to modify and expand 
Done:
|| Instrument tabs to fill inquery
|| Architecture
|| Business process flow chart
|| CV (check spelling) 
|| linkedIn
|| Table Access segregation model
|| Git (ts or js, release, export main functions from PG and add them to the repository, add PG database backup file)

ToDo
|| Q&A Angualar, postgres
|| Create AAM presentation with screen from the interface which highlight core functionality
Done:
|| AA Stie - MyPage - Add link to the repository of the AAM project
|| AAA: updated/expanded top menu with navigation to the main pages
* Fx: SWIFT proccessing - show dates with messages. Done via restored style class
* Fix complex search of imported quotes. There is a null chip in the autocomplete list and set search date interval by default on today
* Fix: Creating Fee schedule: Validation of form is failed although all fields are okay
* Fix: Forbid to delete portfolio's fee schedule if there's created calculations - Done via trigger

Phase 2:
|| Multi Currencies accounts
|| Fx client conversion, fx market trade
|| FX management: OCP (open currency position), exposure
