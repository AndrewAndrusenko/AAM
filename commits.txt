Orders Creation DB function and UI => Blocked creation of new orders with oppositie direction to the exist ones. For examlple if for any given pair portfolio - secid of potential buy order there is a sell not-accounted order then DB function f_i_o_create_orders_by_mp will generate an error message. The main issue with implementing is to generate exception in postgres function and then use the same dataset one more time to insert new orders. Using SELECT INTO in WITH clause is forbidden and to avoid duplicate query the decesion is to create temp table to store portential new orders
